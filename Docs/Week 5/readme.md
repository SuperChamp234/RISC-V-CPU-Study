# RISC-V CPU on FPGA

This project is an implementation of a RISC-V ISA CPU Core on an FPGA. All of the core is written in Verilog HDL using Intel Quartus development tools.

## Preface

RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Architecture) is an open standard **instruction set architecture** (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, the RISC-V ISA is provided under **open source licenses** that do not require fees to use.

This open-source nature of RISC-V is crucial because it allows smaller developers and manufacturers to design and build hardware without the cost of licensing proprietary ISAs and paying royalties.

## Building and Installing

- First Clone the repository,  and load the quartus prime project.

- The simulation can then be started by keeping the main `RISC_V.v` file as the top level module.
